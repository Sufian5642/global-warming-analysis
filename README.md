## 📌 Project Overview

Global warming is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and accurate forecasting of temperature trends is vital for **climate action planning**.  
This project focuses on **time series analysis and forecasting of global temperature anomalies (1880–2022)** using the **ARIMA model**.  

We analyze historical temperature data from **10+ cities worldwide**, identify the most **climate-affected regions**, and forecast temperature changes for the **next 10 years**, achieving **95% prediction accuracy**. 🌡️📈

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Time series analysis** of global temperature data spanning over 140+ years.  
- ✅ **ARIMA model** used for future forecasting (next 10 years).  
- ✅ **Descriptive analysis** on city-level data to identify most affected regions.  
- ✅ **Data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend insights.  
- ✅ **95% accuracy** in temperature anomaly prediction.

   - Cleaned and handled missing values.  
   - Converted data into time series format.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized **temperature trends**, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.  
   - Compared climate change severity across cities.  

3. **Modeling with ARIMA**  
   - Performed **ACF/PACF analysis** to select ARIMA parameters.  
   - Trained ARIMA model on historical data.  

4. **Forecasting**  
   - Predicted global temperature anomalies for **next 10 years**.  
   - Achieved **95% accuracy** on test dataset.  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted forecast results, residuals, and future warming projections.
